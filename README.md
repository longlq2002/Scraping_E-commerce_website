# Scraping_E-commerce_website
#### Web scraping is the process of extracting data and content from websites for various analysis purposes.
#### In this project, I am using the Python programming language to scrape data about Converse shoes from the e-commerce website Ebay. The currency used in the project (Price column) is VND (Vietnamese Dong), but you can change it to a different currency by modifying the region on the Ebay website.
#### Most of the code is contained in Jupyter notebooks. Although these files can be viewed directly on your GitHub browser or any IDE, I recommend using Jupyter notebooks to view them for the best experience.
